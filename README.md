# Spotify Listening Analysis

A data analysis project exploring my personal Spotify listening history to uncover patterns in music preferences, listening behavior, and how my taste has evolved over time.

This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and working with real-world datasets.

---

# Objectives

This project answers the following questions:

* Who are my top artists, songs, and genres?
* How do my listening habits vary by time of day and day of week?
* What audio characteristics define my favorite music?
* How has my music taste changed over time?
* What patterns exist in skipped vs completed songs?

---

# Dataset

The dataset was obtained directly from Spotify using their data export tool.

It includes:

* Streaming history (timestamps, artist, track, duration)
* Track listening duration
* Listening timestamps across multiple years

Note: Raw data is excluded from this repository for privacy.

# Key Insights (Work in Progress)

Examples of insights discovered:

* Most listening occurs during late night hours
* Music preferences shift toward higher energy tracks over time
* Certain artists have higher skip rates than others

(More insights will be added as analysis progresses)
